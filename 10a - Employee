/*****************************

NOTE: 
Before executing this code, make sure you change the working folder to the desktop otherwise the file won't be created.
To work with files, the working directory should be the same as that where the file is being created and the executable 
./a.out will be run.
else you will have to specify the entire path of file in the filename which is a hectic task.
So make sure you do this.

Open terminal and use the following commands: 
Mac/Linux users: cd Desktop
Windows users: I hate you ! :P
